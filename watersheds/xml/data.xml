My wish is that my grandchildren grow up to love their country and are as proud to be Canadian as their grandparents are. I wish that Canada will continue to be the safe, inclusive, opportune country that I grew up in. That Canadians continue to have the reputation of being really 'nice' people world wide.

I can see Canada become the leader in setting the standards for measuring the quality of life based on people's engagement in their communities, in shaping and living their cities. Canadian cities should aspire to become global cities in scale but with human scaled environments and communities that embrace individuality, cultural diversity while encouraging social interaction and positive change.

&quot;A Canada filled with livable communities. I grew up in a bedroom community in the Greater Toronto Area. My childhood spent in suburbia deeply informs my dream for Canada. I wish to see Canadian cities and towns with geographically dispersed jobs and convenient public transportation. I wish to see the end of commuting for hours on end because all the jobs are in one part of the city and all the affordable housing is far away in another, and all that separates them are roads friendly only to the automobile. I wish to see cities feature greater walkability, and to be specific, incorporate more mixed-use zoning. I want us to feel more connected to each other. Cities, strangely enough, can feel lonely, especially after you leave school. It doesn't have to be that way. I wish for strong and supported community organizations, which build civic pride and become powerful spaces for community engagement. I wish for institutions and infrastructure that support individual and community well-being. Communities need to not just be economically and environmentally sustainable; to truly be livable, they also need to be socially sustainable. I want to see Canadians - what a beautiful, diverse group we are - doing extraordinary things in our extraordinary corner of the world. That is what I wish for Canada.&quot;

When the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action were released, Inuk throat singer and Polaris prize winner Tania Tagaq tweeted that reconciliation includes “an equal and opposite reaction to residential schools.” I hope to see the inter-generational trauma caused by an oppressive education system met with increasing support for knowledge sharing and Indigenous education systems. A sesquicentennial Canada is a Canada that owns its wrongdoings, acknowledges failure, and empowers those that it has marginalized.

I hope that over the next 150 years, Canada becomes embraces more equity and equality for minorities, such as people of colour and women. As the people in this world mingle more and more due to globalization and immigration, I hope Canada realizes that while we do not have to give up our own culture in order for us to live in peace with other people, neither do they. They will respect our ways, yes, but we must also respect theirs, and not try to take away things such as their right to practice their religion. My hope for Canada in the future is to not be afraid of others who are not like us, and to be as inclusive and supportive of different groups in our society as possible.

I'm kind of a conspiracy/apocalypse nut but truthfully I hope that rising sea water doesn't take away our awesome coastal regions and that earthquakes don't destroy Vancouver. It would be amazing to see more disaster preparedness in our cities as Vancouver has practically nothing and the citizens freak out if its snows a couple centimetres. Generally I would like to see Canada taking those things more seriously as I believe the environment might take a dip for the worst in the next 150 years.

My dream for Canada is to have a well-connected network of thriving communities from coast to coast. I would like to see our country run 100% on renewable energy, and have communities be in control of their energy systems. I would like to see a country where communities are proud of their individual identities created by the Canadians who live there, based on their unique landscape, history, music and culture. I would like cities to be planned and designed at the human scale, making walking, cycling and public meeting spaces priorities at all times.I would like to see a mass public transit network that connects these communities to each other and to the beautiful nature that we are ever so lucky to be surrounded by.

movements towards environmental innovation. Canada has been a disappointing example in the past after dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, relying on the tar sands for economic growth, and becoming internationally known as the reckless mining country in the global south. I truly hope that in the next 150 years, we can do a better job at being a global leader in environmentalism. Lastly, I’ve done a bit of traveling and although there are beautiful countries and cultures in the world, I am constantly reminded about how lucky I am to call Canada my home. I am so humbled to be Canadian and I hope that never changes.

But, I also hope that it is able to preserve its culture and its natural environment and doesn't lose it in this mad race of becoming an economic powerhouse. I wish that Canada stays as safe it is currently and its citizens stay united and always uphold the ethic they have carried and also its constitution.

In the next 150 years, I would like to see Canada abandon neoliberal economic policies. Rather than reducing the size of social programs in order to promote free markets, I would like to see increased funding for public transport, affordable housing, healthcare, first nations communities etc. In addition, I hope that narratives around sustainability can move away from ethical consumerism, towards a greater understanding of systems. Often, environmental problems are reduced to the level of the individual, however I believe that it is a problem best solved through collective political action. For instance, there is a push for the individual consumer to buy more local and organic food. However I don't think that we can talk about buying more local and organic food without talking about a higher (living) minimum wage. It is this systems approach to sustainability which I would like to see become a conventional wisdom in Canada over the next 150 years.

My wish for Canada's next 150 years, are cities which make it easier for citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. For example, this means a built environment which incentivizes behaviour with positive externalities (e.g. transport choices such cycling and walking, which are low-cost and provide a net benefit in terms of individual quality of life, the environment, as well as public finances).

I wish for Canada to continue to engage in meaningful change, especially in regards to improving Native communities. Canada's story is quite unique in its demographic diversity with many living in Canada considering it their second home. I wish to see Canada's foreign policy be a testament to bettering the homelands of it's citizens. I wish for Canada, federally, provincially and locally to show ourselves and the world why we are the nicest people and for this to be seen in all aspects of society (economic system, environmental stance and social justice). I believe we are on our way to seeing this happen.

In the next 150 years, I hope Canada may remain multicultural and accepting of other cultures as it is now. But I hope in time that we can go a step further with (a) better integration of different cultures and people (b) more acceptance and understanding of other people's cultural instead of just tolerance that others are different. I hope we continue being the Canada the world knows - with the values of accepting new cultures with open arms. In the future I hope we don't ban other cultures from practicing their values and insist on conforming / assimilating to be Canadian. I definitely want to work towards continuing that in my professional career with policy.

Before we continue into the next 150 years of Canada's history, I would love for us to publicly accept and apologize for certain things that have occurred in the past. I believe that to truly move forward we must strengthen the cracks in our foundation, namely surrounding our relationship with the people of The First Nation.
 In the next 150 years, I wish for Canada to continue on the trajectory that the country has recently carved out for itself as a forward thinking, contemporary and accepting home for people of all walks of life. I wish for Canada's culture to flourish and evolve whilst always inheriting new cultures from those that immigrate into her.
 I wish for the Maple Leafs to win a Stanley Cup. I'm hoping 150 years is a long enough time...

Canada is doing great things right now, but we need to work more collaboratively to identify and address the issues youth in various parts of the country face. A youth in Yukon is facing significantly different issues then a youth in Jane Finch for example, but these issues are important. Canada needs create more dialogue.

There are several issues that I would like to see resolved within my lifetime, much earlier than 150 years from now, but I will discuss two. The number one issue that needs immediate attention is the unacceptable conditions of Indigenous communities across the country. Today, we still have many communities struggling with epidemics of youth suicide and domestic violence, substance abuse, a vast lack of employment opportunities, among many other issues. Culminating in the height of the emergency status that many Indigenous communities and individuals have existed in for decades is the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women - an issue that I relate to, to an extent, as a young, racialized, female survivor of sexual assault. My feelings on the topic of Indigenous issues in our country are so powerful that I believe we need to actively work towards reconciliation and solutions as soon as possible, in order to be a genuine global leader on social justice issues. The second issue I find most pressing in Canada, vital to change within 150 years, is electoral reform. Our current First-Past-The-Post system is outdated, limited, and unfair to the diversity of issues and interests that communities have throughout the country. A move away from such a system that encourages strategic voting will ensure that our key democratic processes are renewed and that our votes start to truly count.

I hope in the next 150 years we can become a country where all youth really do have equal opportunity, especially aboriginal youth, and that we can teach future generations to appreciate not just the history of Canada after the Europeans came but also the rich history of aboriginal cultures. I believe young Canadians don't know enough about the history of our country and therefore have difficulty truly appreciating it and how much better this country has become since it began.

Canada has done a fantastic job fostering national pride and reaping the benefits of our land over the past 150 years. As technology progresses I look forward to further development and urbanization in less populated areas of Canada as well as increased attention on the needs of its citizens. Past models of segregation and separation will hopefully be lomg eradicated and replaced with mixed neighborhood models to encourage conversation between peoples. There will be an increased quality of life and Canada will continue to be known as one of the safest places to live.

I hope that Canada will pursue the concept of sustainability and stop using more resources than the world can afford.

What would I like to see in the next 150 years of Canadian history? Women make up 51% o the global population. It would be phenomenal is the pay gap would finally cease to exist (it has been an issue for the last 70 years). Also, women should have more authority and positions of power. Secondly, Canada should respect the environment of abundance that we currently have. The way we are treating our country, we won’t make it to the next 150 years. It is our duty to respect what we have. Stop exploiting our country for profit. Canada has one fifth of the world’s fresh water. Just because those in politics, currently, won’t be on the earth much longer (in comparison) doesn’t mean they can’t think towards the future and the generations to follow. Don’t make your reports look good at the expense of human life.

My wish for Canada in the next 150 years would be… For Canada to become more easily and affordably accessible for its citizens and travellers by implementation of low cost airlines and better use of more efficient rail systems. This will create opportunities for citizens and businesses as well as open the doors to travellers. Let’s be more open to the world!

I wish for Canada to completely get rid of racism. There is no place for hate in this world, especially hate rooted in ignorance and misinformation. I think there should be more social awareness of why we as a nation should stand against crimes from racism. I will start with changing my thinking and raising children in the future who understand and value all Canadian groups.

Provide everyone the “warm”. As no longer after, the conflict between Native people will be solved by honesty, kindness and peace. No discrimination existing anymore. Everyone can learn the history to prevent the wrongs from happening again. More love and more peace.

Canada should give back the respect, dignity and status back to Indigenous people. As is is very important for each and every individual who breathes on earth. Without considering sex, race, ethnicity and culture etc. into their agenda. Firstly, all are humans beings after that everyone has to be treated equally in the Rule of Law. It is really a sensitive issue in today’s world in all the countries.

I wish that in the next 150 years in Canada that Indian Residential Schools are educated through all grades to bring awareness to the current and future inter-generational effects of trauma, shame and culture. This is significant considering Canada is in treaties with Indigenous people and their history matters. This will prevent negative perspectives and judgements towards Indigenous people.

I have seen Canada as one step ahead from most of the countries I have been in, but if I wish what Canada should be in the next 150 years is that it should be more open to all other types of people maybe in terms of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation etc. We should see all with one eye whether it is from any race. I will and am trying my best to see the world as well as my society in more open ways where everybody is same and there is no discrimination. The best and foremost to this solution should be providing EDUCATION. This is key to everything.

&quot;A Canada filled with livable communities. I grew up in a bedroom community in the Greater Toronto Area. My childhood spent in suburbia deeply informs my dream for Canada. I wish to see Canadian cities and towns with geographically dispersed jobs and convenient public transportation. I wish to see the end of commuting for hours on end because all the jobs are in one part of the city and all the affordable housing is far away in another, and all that separates them are roads friendly only to the automobile. I wish to see cities feature greater walkability, and to be specific, incorporate more mixed-use zoning. I want us to feel more connected to each other. Cities, strangely enough, can feel lonely, especially after you leave school. It doesn't have to be that way. I wish for strong and supported community organizations, which build civic pride and become powerful spaces for community engagement. I wish for institutions and infrastructure that support individual and community well-being. Communities need to not just be economically and environmentally sustainable; to truly be livable, they also need to be socially sustainable. I want to see Canadians - what a beautiful, diverse group we are - doing extraordinary things in our extraordinary corner of the world. That is what I wish for Canada.&quot;

I hope that over the next 150 years, Canada becomes embraces more equity and equality for minorities, such as people of colour and women. As the people in this world mingle more and more due to globalization and immigration, I hope Canada realizes that while we do not have to give up our own culture in order for us to live in peace with other people, neither do they. They will respect our ways, yes, but we must also respect theirs, and not try to take away things such as their right to practice their religion. My hope for Canada in the future is to not be afraid of others who are not like us, and to be as inclusive and supportive of different groups in our society as possible.

I'm kind of a conspiracy/apocalypse nut but truthfully I hope that rising sea water doesn't take away our awesome coastal regions and that earthquakes don't destroy Vancouver. It would be amazing to see more disaster preparedness in our cities as Vancouver has practically nothing and the citizens freak out if its snows a couple centimetres. Generally I would like to see Canada taking those things more seriously as I believe the environment might take a dip for the worst in the next 150 years.

I would like to see our country run 100% on renewable energy, and have communities be in control of their energy systems. I would like to see a country where communities are proud of their individual identities created by the Canadians who live there, based on their unique landscape, history, music and culture. I would like cities to be planned and designed at the human scale, making walking, cycling and public meeting spaces priorities at all times.I would like to see a mass public transit network that connects these communities to each other and to the beautiful nature that we are ever so lucky to be surrounded by.

movements towards environmental innovation. Canada has been a disappointing example in the past after dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, relying on the tar sands for economic growth, and becoming internationally known as the reckless mining country in the global south. I truly hope that in the next 150 years, we can do a better job at being a global leader in environmentalism. Lastly, I’ve done a bit of traveling and although there are beautiful countries and cultures in the world, I am constantly reminded about how lucky I am to call Canada my home. I am so humbled to be Canadian and I hope that never changes.

In the next 150 years, I would like to see Canada abandon neoliberal economic policies. Rather than reducing the size of social programs in order to promote free markets, I would like to see increased funding for public transport, affordable housing, healthcare, first nations communities etc. In addition, I hope that narratives around sustainability can move away from ethical consumerism, towards a greater understanding of systems. Often, environmental problems are reduced to the level of the individual, however I believe that it is a problem best solved through collective political action. For instance, there is a push for the individual consumer to buy more local and organic food. However I don't think that we can talk about buying more local and organic food without talking about a higher (living) minimum wage. It is this systems approach to sustainability which I would like to see become a conventional wisdom in Canada over the next 150 years.

My wish for Canada's next 150 years, are cities which make it easier for citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. For example, this means a built environment which incentivizes behaviour with positive externalities (e.g. transport choices such cycling and walking, which are low-cost and provide a net benefit in terms of individual quality of life, the environment, as well as public finances).

Canada's story is quite unique in its demographic diversity with many living in Canada considering it their second home. I wish to see Canada's foreign policy be a testament to bettering the homelands of it's citizens. I wish for Canada, federally, provincially and locally to show ourselves and the world why we are the nicest people and for this to be seen in all aspects of society (economic system, environmental stance and social justice). I believe we are on our way to seeing this happen.

In the next 150 years, I hope Canada may remain multicultural and accepting of other cultures as it is now. But I hope in time that we can go a step further with (a) better integration of different cultures and people (b) more acceptance and understanding of other people's cultural instead of just tolerance that others are different. I hope we continue being the Canada the world knows - with the values of accepting new cultures with open arms. In the future I hope we don't ban other cultures from practicing their values and insist on conforming / assimilating to be Canadian. I definitely want to work towards continuing that in my professional career with policy.

Before we continue into the next 150 years of Canada's history, I would love for us to publicly accept and apologize for certain things that have occurred in the past. I believe that to truly move forward we must strengthen the cracks in our foundation, namely surrounding our relationship with the people of The First Nation.
 In the next 150 years, I wish for Canada to continue on the trajectory that the country has recently carved out for itself as a forward thinking, contemporary and accepting home for people of all walks of life. I wish for Canada's culture to flourish and evolve whilst always inheriting new cultures from those that immigrate into her.
 I wish for the Maple Leafs to win a Stanley Cup. I'm hoping 150 years is a long enough time...

There are several issues that I would like to see resolved within my lifetime, much earlier than 150 years from now, but I will discuss two. The number one issue that needs immediate attention is the unacceptable conditions of Indigenous communities across the country. Today, we still have many communities struggling with epidemics of youth suicide and domestic violence, substance abuse, a vast lack of employment opportunities, among many other issues. Culminating in the height of the emergency status that many Indigenous communities and individuals have existed in for decades is the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women - an issue that I relate to, to an extent, as a young, racialized, female survivor of sexual assault. My feelings on the topic of Indigenous issues in our country are so powerful that I believe we need to actively work towards reconciliation and solutions as soon as possible, in order to be a genuine global leader on social justice issues. The second issue I find most pressing in Canada, vital to change within 150 years, is electoral reform. Our current First-Past-The-Post system is outdated, limited, and unfair to the diversity of issues and interests that communities have throughout the country. A move away from such a system that encourages strategic voting will ensure that our key democratic processes are renewed and that our votes start to truly count.

Canada has done a fantastic job fostering national pride and reaping the benefits of our land over the past 150 years. As technology progresses I look forward to further development and urbanization in less populated areas of Canada as well as increased attention on the needs of its citizens. Past models of segregation and separation will hopefully be lomg eradicated and replaced with mixed neighborhood models to encourage conversation between peoples. There will be an increased quality of life and Canada will continue to be known as one of the safest places to live.

What would I like to see in the next 150 years of Canadian history? Women make up 51% o the global population. It would be phenomenal is the pay gap would finally cease to exist (it has been an issue for the last 70 years). Also, women should have more authority and positions of power. Secondly, Canada should respect the environment of abundance that we currently have. The way we are treating our country, we won’t make it to the next 150 years. It is our duty to respect what we have. Stop exploiting our country for profit. Canada has one fifth of the world’s fresh water. Just because those in politics, currently, won’t be on the earth much longer (in comparison) doesn’t mean they can’t think towards the future and the generations to follow. Don’t make your reports look good at the expense of human life.

I have seen Canada as one step ahead from most of the countries I have been in, but if I wish what Canada should be in the next 150 years is that it should be more open to all other types of people maybe in terms of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation etc. We should see all with one eye whether it is from any race. I will and am trying my best to see the world as well as my society in more open ways where everybody is same and there is no discrimination. The best and foremost to this solution should be providing EDUCATION. This is key to everything.

&quot;A Canada filled with livable communities. I grew up in a bedroom community in the Greater Toronto Area. My childhood spent in suburbia deeply informs my dream for Canada. I wish to see Canadian cities and towns with geographically dispersed jobs and convenient public transportation. I wish to see the end of commuting for hours on end because all the jobs are in one part of the city and all the affordable housing is far away in another, and all that separates them are roads friendly only to the automobile. I wish to see cities feature greater walkability, and to be specific, incorporate more mixed-use zoning. I want us to feel more connected to each other. Cities, strangely enough, can feel lonely, especially after you leave school. It doesn't have to be that way. I wish for strong and supported community organizations, which build civic pride and become powerful spaces for community engagement. I wish for institutions and infrastructure that support individual and community well-being. Communities need to not just be economically and environmentally sustainable; to truly be livable, they also need to be socially sustainable. I want to see Canadians - what a beautiful, diverse group we are - doing extraordinary things in our extraordinary corner of the world. That is what I wish for Canada.&quot;

When the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action were released, Inuk throat singer and Polaris prize winner Tania Tagaq tweeted that reconciliation includes “an equal and opposite reaction to residential schools.” I hope to see the inter-generational trauma caused by an oppressive education system met with increasing support for knowledge sharing and Indigenous education systems. A sesquicentennial Canada is a Canada that owns its wrongdoings, acknowledges failure, and empowers those that it has marginalized.

I hope that over the next 150 years, Canada becomes embraces more equity and equality for minorities, such as people of colour and women. As the people in this world mingle more and more due to globalization and immigration, I hope Canada realizes that while we do not have to give up our own culture in order for us to live in peace with other people, neither do they. They will respect our ways, yes, but we must also respect theirs, and not try to take away things such as their right to practice their religion. My hope for Canada in the future is to not be afraid of others who are not like us, and to be as inclusive and supportive of different groups in our society as possible.

I'm kind of a conspiracy/apocalypse nut but truthfully I hope that rising sea water doesn't take away our awesome coastal regions and that earthquakes don't destroy Vancouver. It would be amazing to see more disaster preparedness in our cities as Vancouver has practically nothing and the citizens freak out if its snows a couple centimetres. Generally I would like to see Canada taking those things more seriously as I believe the environment might take a dip for the worst in the next 150 years.

My dream for Canada is to have a well-connected network of thriving communities from coast to coast. I would like to see our country run 100% on renewable energy, and have communities be in control of their energy systems. I would like to see a country where communities are proud of their individual identities created by the Canadians who live there, based on their unique landscape, history, music and culture. I would like cities to be planned and designed at the human scale, making walking, cycling and public meeting spaces priorities at all times.I would like to see a mass public transit network that connects these communities to each other and to the beautiful nature that we are ever so lucky to be surrounded by.

movements towards environmental innovation. Canada has been a disappointing example in the past after dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, relying on the tar sands for economic growth, and becoming internationally known as the reckless mining country in the global south. I truly hope that in the next 150 years, we can do a better job at being a global leader in environmentalism. Lastly, I’ve done a bit of traveling and although there are beautiful countries and cultures in the world, I am constantly reminded about how lucky I am to call Canada my home. I am so humbled to be Canadian and I hope that never changes.

In the next 150 years, I would like to see Canada abandon neoliberal economic policies. Rather than reducing the size of social programs in order to promote free markets, I would like to see increased funding for public transport, affordable housing, healthcare, first nations communities etc. In addition, I hope that narratives around sustainability can move away from ethical consumerism, towards a greater understanding of systems. Often, environmental problems are reduced to the level of the individual, however I believe that it is a problem best solved through collective political action. For instance, there is a push for the individual consumer to buy more local and organic food. However I don't think that we can talk about buying more local and organic food without talking about a higher (living) minimum wage. It is this systems approach to sustainability which I would like to see become a conventional wisdom in Canada over the next 150 years.

My wish for Canada's next 150 years, are cities which make it easier for citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. For example, this means a built environment which incentivizes behaviour with positive externalities (e.g. transport choices such cycling and walking, which are low-cost and provide a net benefit in terms of individual quality of life, the environment, as well as public finances).

I wish for Canada to continue to engage in meaningful change, especially in regards to improving Native communities. Canada's story is quite unique in its demographic diversity with many living in Canada considering it their second home. I wish to see Canada's foreign policy be a testament to bettering the homelands of it's citizens. I wish for Canada, federally, provincially and locally to show ourselves and the world why we are the nicest people and for this to be seen in all aspects of society (economic system, environmental stance and social justice). I believe we are on our way to seeing this happen.

In the next 150 years, I hope Canada may remain multicultural and accepting of other cultures as it is now. But I hope in time that we can go a step further with (a) better integration of different cultures and people (b) more acceptance and understanding of other people's cultural instead of just tolerance that others are different. I hope we continue being the Canada the world knows - with the values of accepting new cultures with open arms. In the future I hope we don't ban other cultures from practicing their values and insist on conforming / assimilating to be Canadian. I definitely want to work towards continuing that in my professional career with policy.

Before we continue into the next 150 years of Canada's history, I would love for us to publicly accept and apologize for certain things that have occurred in the past. I believe that to truly move forward we must strengthen the cracks in our foundation, namely surrounding our relationship with the people of The First Nation.
 In the next 150 years, I wish for Canada to continue on the trajectory that the country has recently carved out for itself as a forward thinking, contemporary and accepting home for people of all walks of life. I wish for Canada's culture to flourish and evolve whilst always inheriting new cultures from those that immigrate into her.
 I wish for the Maple Leafs to win a Stanley Cup. I'm hoping 150 years is a long enough time...

My wish is that Canada can turn into the world’s hub for creatives, making Canada the place to be when wanting to launch your career in the arts. Many musicians, script writers and people in the creative field have to travel abroad to launch their careers. It would be exciting to see Toronto become the creative hub supporting creatives and launching their careers.

There are several issues that I would like to see resolved within my lifetime, much earlier than 150 years from now, but I will discuss two. The number one issue that needs immediate attention is the unacceptable conditions of Indigenous communities across the country. Today, we still have many communities struggling with epidemics of youth suicide and domestic violence, substance abuse, a vast lack of employment opportunities, among many other issues. Culminating in the height of the emergency status that many Indigenous communities and individuals have existed in for decades is the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women - an issue that I relate to, to an extent, as a young, racialized, female survivor of sexual assault. My feelings on the topic of Indigenous issues in our country are so powerful that I believe we need to actively work towards reconciliation and solutions as soon as possible, in order to be a genuine global leader on social justice issues. The second issue I find most pressing in Canada, vital to change within 150 years, is electoral reform. Our current First-Past-The-Post system is outdated, limited, and unfair to the diversity of issues and interests that communities have throughout the country. A move away from such a system that encourages strategic voting will ensure that our key democratic processes are renewed and that our votes start to truly count.

I hope in the next 150 years we can become a country where all youth really do have equal opportunity, especially aboriginal youth, and that we can teach future generations to appreciate not just the history of Canada after the Europeans came but also the rich history of aboriginal cultures. I believe young Canadians don't know enough about the history of our country and therefore have difficulty truly appreciating it and how much better this country has become since it began.

Canada has done a fantastic job fostering national pride and reaping the benefits of our land over the past 150 years. As technology progresses I look forward to further development and urbanization in less populated areas of Canada as well as increased attention on the needs of its citizens. Past models of segregation and separation will hopefully be lomg eradicated and replaced with mixed neighborhood models to encourage conversation between peoples. There will be an increased quality of life and Canada will continue to be known as one of the safest places to live.

What would I like to see in the next 150 years of Canadian history? Women make up 51% o the global population. It would be phenomenal is the pay gap would finally cease to exist (it has been an issue for the last 70 years). Also, women should have more authority and positions of power. Secondly, Canada should respect the environment of abundance that we currently have. The way we are treating our country, we won’t make it to the next 150 years. It is our duty to respect what we have. Stop exploiting our country for profit. Canada has one fifth of the world’s fresh water. Just because those in politics, currently, won’t be on the earth much longer (in comparison) doesn’t mean they can’t think towards the future and the generations to follow. Don’t make your reports look good at the expense of human life.

I have seen Canada as one step ahead from most of the countries I have been in, but if I wish what Canada should be in the next 150 years is that it should be more open to all other types of people maybe in terms of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation etc. We should see all with one eye whether it is from any race. I will and am trying my best to see the world as well as my society in more open ways where everybody is same and there is no discrimination. The best and foremost to this solution should be providing EDUCATION. This is key to everything.

Education is key. Through grades 1-8 there needs to be mandatory Indigenous study each year. Hard topics need to be addressed and brought up early in schooling it should also be a required high school class as well as a 6 credit university requirement.

My Wish is for Canada to be a major player in addressing climate change, human rights issues and protection of people at home and abroad. Also for Canada to be a more democratic society. Find a way to open the discussion to all. Provide opportunities for more people to be heard.

&quot;A Canada filled with livable communities. I grew up in a bedroom community in the Greater Toronto Area. My childhood spent in suburbia deeply informs my dream for Canada. I wish to see Canadian cities and towns with geographically dispersed jobs and convenient public transportation. I wish to see the end of commuting for hours on end because all the jobs are in one part of the city and all the affordable housing is far away in another, and all that separates them are roads friendly only to the automobile. I wish to see cities feature greater walkability, and to be specific, incorporate more mixed-use zoning. I want us to feel more connected to each other. Cities, strangely enough, can feel lonely, especially after you leave school. It doesn't have to be that way. I wish for strong and supported community organizations, which build civic pride and become powerful spaces for community engagement. I wish for institutions and infrastructure that support individual and community well-being. Communities need to not just be economically and environmentally sustainable; to truly be livable, they also need to be socially sustainable. I want to see Canadians - what a beautiful, diverse group we are - doing extraordinary things in our extraordinary corner of the world. That is what I wish for Canada.&quot;

When the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action were released, Inuk throat singer and Polaris prize winner Tania Tagaq tweeted that reconciliation includes “an equal and opposite reaction to residential schools.” I hope to see the inter-generational trauma caused by an oppressive education system met with increasing support for knowledge sharing and Indigenous education systems. A sesquicentennial Canada is a Canada that owns its wrongdoings, acknowledges failure, and empowers those that it has marginalized.

I hope that over the next 150 years, Canada becomes embraces more equity and equality for minorities, such as people of colour and women. As the people in this world mingle more and more due to globalization and immigration, I hope Canada realizes that while we do not have to give up our own culture in order for us to live in peace with other people, neither do they. They will respect our ways, yes, but we must also respect theirs, and not try to take away things such as their right to practice their religion. My hope for Canada in the future is to not be afraid of others who are not like us, and to be as inclusive and supportive of different groups in our society as possible.

I'm kind of a conspiracy/apocalypse nut but truthfully I hope that rising sea water doesn't take away our awesome coastal regions and that earthquakes don't destroy Vancouver. It would be amazing to see more disaster preparedness in our cities as Vancouver has practically nothing and the citizens freak out if its snows a couple centimetres. Generally I would like to see Canada taking those things more seriously as I believe the environment might take a dip for the worst in the next 150 years.

My dream for Canada is to have a well-connected network of thriving communities from coast to coast. I would like to see our country run 100% on renewable energy, and have communities be in control of their energy systems. I would like to see a country where communities are proud of their individual identities created by the Canadians who live there, based on their unique landscape, history, music and culture. I would like cities to be planned and designed at the human scale, making walking, cycling and public meeting spaces priorities at all times.I would like to see a mass public transit network that connects these communities to each other and to the beautiful nature that we are ever so lucky to be surrounded by.

movements towards environmental innovation. Canada has been a disappointing example in the past after dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, relying on the tar sands for economic growth, and becoming internationally known as the reckless mining country in the global south. I truly hope that in the next 150 years, we can do a better job at being a global leader in environmentalism. Lastly, I’ve done a bit of traveling and although there are beautiful countries and cultures in the world, I am constantly reminded about how lucky I am to call Canada my home. I am so humbled to be Canadian and I hope that never changes.

I just wish it keeps maintaining its pluralistic and multicultural society. I wish Canada become the business hub and creates job both for its citizens and the others worldwide. But, I also hope that it is able to preserve its culture and its natural environment and doesn't lose it in this mad race of becoming an economic powerhouse. I wish that Canada stays as safe it is currently and its citizens stay united and always uphold the ethic they have carried and also its constitution.

In the next 150 years, I would like to see Canada abandon neoliberal economic policies. Rather than reducing the size of social programs in order to promote free markets, I would like to see increased funding for public transport, affordable housing, healthcare, first nations communities etc. In addition, I hope that narratives around sustainability can move away from ethical consumerism, towards a greater understanding of systems. Often, environmental problems are reduced to the level of the individual, however I believe that it is a problem best solved through collective political action. For instance, there is a push for the individual consumer to buy more local and organic food. However I don't think that we can talk about buying more local and organic food without talking about a higher (living) minimum wage. It is this systems approach to sustainability which I would like to see become a conventional wisdom in Canada over the next 150 years.

My wish for Canada's next 150 years, are cities which make it easier for citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. For example, this means a built environment which incentivizes behaviour with positive externalities (e.g. transport choices such cycling and walking, which are low-cost and provide a net benefit in terms of individual quality of life, the environment, as well as public finances).

I wish for Canada to continue to engage in meaningful change, especially in regards to improving Native communities. Canada's story is quite unique in its demographic diversity with many living in Canada considering it their second home. I wish to see Canada's foreign policy be a testament to bettering the homelands of it's citizens. I wish for Canada, federally, provincially and locally to show ourselves and the world why we are the nicest people and for this to be seen in all aspects of society (economic system, environmental stance and social justice). I believe we are on our way to seeing this happen.

In the next 150 years, I hope Canada may remain multicultural and accepting of other cultures as it is now. But I hope in time that we can go a step further with (a) better integration of different cultures and people (b) more acceptance and understanding of other people's cultural instead of just tolerance that others are different. I hope we continue being the Canada the world knows - with the values of accepting new cultures with open arms. In the future I hope we don't ban other cultures from practicing their values and insist on conforming / assimilating to be Canadian. I definitely want to work towards continuing that in my professional career with policy.

Before we continue into the next 150 years of Canada's history, I would love for us to publicly accept and apologize for certain things that have occurred in the past. I believe that to truly move forward we must strengthen the cracks in our foundation, namely surrounding our relationship with the people of The First Nation.
 In the next 150 years, I wish for Canada to continue on the trajectory that the country has recently carved out for itself as a forward thinking, contemporary and accepting home for people of all walks of life. I wish for Canada's culture to flourish and evolve whilst always inheriting new cultures from those that immigrate into her.
 I wish for the Maple Leafs to win a Stanley Cup. I'm hoping 150 years is a long enough time...

My hope for Canada is to grow as a more harmonious country. Canada is doing great things right now, but we need to work more collaboratively to identify and address the issues youth in various parts of the country face. A youth in Yukon is facing significantly different issues then a youth in Jane Finch for example, but these issues are important. Canada needs create more dialogue.

There are several issues that I would like to see resolved within my lifetime, much earlier than 150 years from now, but I will discuss two. The number one issue that needs immediate attention is the unacceptable conditions of Indigenous communities across the country. Today, we still have many communities struggling with epidemics of youth suicide and domestic violence, substance abuse, a vast lack of employment opportunities, among many other issues. Culminating in the height of the emergency status that many Indigenous communities and individuals have existed in for decades is the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women - an issue that I relate to, to an extent, as a young, racialized, female survivor of sexual assault. My feelings on the topic of Indigenous issues in our country are so powerful that I believe we need to actively work towards reconciliation and solutions as soon as possible, in order to be a genuine global leader on social justice issues. The second issue I find most pressing in Canada, vital to change within 150 years, is electoral reform. Our current First-Past-The-Post system is outdated, limited, and unfair to the diversity of issues and interests that communities have throughout the country. A move away from such a system that encourages strategic voting will ensure that our key democratic processes are renewed and that our votes start to truly count.

I hope in the next 150 years we can become a country where all youth really do have equal opportunity, especially aboriginal youth, and that we can teach future generations to appreciate not just the history of Canada after the Europeans came but also the rich history of aboriginal cultures. I believe young Canadians don't know enough about the history of our country and therefore have difficulty truly appreciating it and how much better this country has become since it began.

Canada has done a fantastic job fostering national pride and reaping the benefits of our land over the past 150 years. As technology progresses I look forward to further development and urbanization in less populated areas of Canada as well as increased attention on the needs of its citizens. Past models of segregation and separation will hopefully be lomg eradicated and replaced with mixed neighborhood models to encourage conversation between peoples. There will be an increased quality of life and Canada will continue to be known as one of the safest places to live.

What would I like to see in the next 150 years of Canadian history? Women make up 51% o the global population. It would be phenomenal is the pay gap would finally cease to exist (it has been an issue for the last 70 years). Also, women should have more authority and positions of power. Secondly, Canada should respect the environment of abundance that we currently have. The way we are treating our country, we won’t make it to the next 150 years. It is our duty to respect what we have. Stop exploiting our country for profit. Canada has one fifth of the world’s fresh water. Just because those in politics, currently, won’t be on the earth much longer (in comparison) doesn’t mean they can’t think towards the future and the generations to follow. Don’t make your reports look good at the expense of human life.

I wish everyone will be viewed equally through our society. I wish we can find ways of all coming together and trying to understand one another. How to achieve this is by becoming more active in society to bring awareness on global rights issues.

I wish for Canada to completely get rid of racism. There is no place for hate in this world, especially hate rooted in ignorance and misinformation. I think there should be more social awareness of why we as a nation should stand against crimes from racism. I will start with changing my thinking and raising children in the future who understand and value all Canadian groups.

My wish is everyone in Canada can be free, everyone who comes to Canada can have fair treatment. As the kindness of accepting refugees from war country. Citizens can treat them as a whole. Provide everyone the “warm”. As no longer after, the conflict between Native people will be solved by honesty, kindness and peace. No discrimination existing anymore. Everyone can learn the history to prevent the wrongs from happening again. More love and more peace.

Canada should give back the respect, dignity and status back to Indigenous people. As is is very important for each and every individual who breathes on earth. Without considering sex, race, ethnicity and culture etc. into their agenda. Firstly, all are humans beings after that everyone has to be treated equally in the Rule of Law. It is really a sensitive issue in today’s world in all the countries.

My wish for Canada is to have inclusive process rather than diverse approach. We can do this by having voice of those who are expert in their own life, to be the leading change maker. And emphasizes on inclusive human rights to economic development and physical safety in Canada’s next 150 years.

I wish that in the next 150 years in Canada that Indian Residential Schools are educated through all grades to bring awareness to the current and future inter-generational effects of trauma, shame and culture. This is significant considering Canada is in treaties with Indigenous people and their history matters. This will prevent negative perspectives and judgements towards Indigenous people.

I have seen Canada as one step ahead from most of the countries I have been in, but if I wish what Canada should be in the next 150 years is that it should be more open to all other types of people maybe in terms of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation etc. We should see all with one eye whether it is from any race. I will and am trying my best to see the world as well as my society in more open ways where everybody is same and there is no discrimination. The best and foremost to this solution should be providing EDUCATION. This is key to everything.

Education is key. Through grades 1-8 there needs to be mandatory Indigenous study each year. Hard topics need to be addressed and brought up early in schooling it should also be a required high school class as well as a 6 credit university requirement.

My wish is that my grandchildren grow up to love their country and are as proud to be Canadian as their grandparents are. I wish that Canada will continue to be the safe, inclusive, opportune country that I grew up in. That Canadians continue to have the reputation of being really 'nice' people world wide.

&quot;A Canada filled with livable communities. I grew up in a bedroom community in the Greater Toronto Area. My childhood spent in suburbia deeply informs my dream for Canada. I wish to see Canadian cities and towns with geographically dispersed jobs and convenient public transportation. I wish to see the end of commuting for hours on end because all the jobs are in one part of the city and all the affordable housing is far away in another, and all that separates them are roads friendly only to the automobile. I wish to see cities feature greater walkability, and to be specific, incorporate more mixed-use zoning. I want us to feel more connected to each other. Cities, strangely enough, can feel lonely, especially after you leave school. It doesn't have to be that way. I wish for strong and supported community organizations, which build civic pride and become powerful spaces for community engagement. I wish for institutions and infrastructure that support individual and community well-being. Communities need to not just be economically and environmentally sustainable; to truly be livable, they also need to be socially sustainable. I want to see Canadians - what a beautiful, diverse group we are - doing extraordinary things in our extraordinary corner of the world. That is what I wish for Canada.&quot;

When the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action were released, Inuk throat singer and Polaris prize winner Tania Tagaq tweeted that reconciliation includes “an equal and opposite reaction to residential schools.” I hope to see the inter-generational trauma caused by an oppressive education system met with increasing support for knowledge sharing and Indigenous education systems. A sesquicentennial Canada is a Canada that owns its wrongdoings, acknowledges failure, and empowers those that it has marginalized.

I hope that over the next 150 years, Canada becomes embraces more equity and equality for minorities, such as people of colour and women. As the people in this world mingle more and more due to globalization and immigration, I hope Canada realizes that while we do not have to give up our own culture in order for us to live in peace with other people, neither do they. They will respect our ways, yes, but we must also respect theirs, and not try to take away things such as their right to practice their religion. My hope for Canada in the future is to not be afraid of others who are not like us, and to be as inclusive and supportive of different groups in our society as possible.

I'm kind of a conspiracy/apocalypse nut but truthfully I hope that rising sea water doesn't take away our awesome coastal regions and that earthquakes don't destroy Vancouver. It would be amazing to see more disaster preparedness in our cities as Vancouver has practically nothing and the citizens freak out if its snows a couple centimetres. Generally I would like to see Canada taking those things more seriously as I believe the environment might take a dip for the worst in the next 150 years.

My hope for Canada in the next 150 years is for the country to increase its diversity and praise the differences. In Halifax, after the Orlando incident, the city coloured it's sidewalks in pride colours. Halifax especially, is extremely diverse and welcoming to all types of people.

My dream for Canada is to have a well-connected network of thriving communities from coast to coast. I would like to see our country run 100% on renewable energy, and have communities be in control of their energy systems. I would like to see a country where communities are proud of their individual identities created by the Canadians who live there, based on their unique landscape, history, music and culture. I would like cities to be planned and designed at the human scale, making walking, cycling and public meeting spaces priorities at all times.I would like to see a mass public transit network that connects these communities to each other and to the beautiful nature that we are ever so lucky to be surrounded by.

movements towards environmental innovation. Canada has been a disappointing example in the past after dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, relying on the tar sands for economic growth, and becoming internationally known as the reckless mining country in the global south. I truly hope that in the next 150 years, we can do a better job at being a global leader in environmentalism. Lastly, I’ve done a bit of traveling and although there are beautiful countries and cultures in the world, I am constantly reminded about how lucky I am to call Canada my home. I am so humbled to be Canadian and I hope that never changes.

I just wish it keeps maintaining its pluralistic and multicultural society. I wish Canada become the business hub and creates job both for its citizens and the others worldwide. But, I also hope that it is able to preserve its culture and its natural environment and doesn't lose it in this mad race of becoming an economic powerhouse. I wish that Canada stays as safe it is currently and its citizens stay united and always uphold the ethic they have carried and also its constitution.

In the next 150 years, I would like to see Canada abandon neoliberal economic policies. Rather than reducing the size of social programs in order to promote free markets, I would like to see increased funding for public transport, affordable housing, healthcare, first nations communities etc. In addition, I hope that narratives around sustainability can move away from ethical consumerism, towards a greater understanding of systems. Often, environmental problems are reduced to the level of the individual, however I believe that it is a problem best solved through collective political action. For instance, there is a push for the individual consumer to buy more local and organic food. However I don't think that we can talk about buying more local and organic food without talking about a higher (living) minimum wage. It is this systems approach to sustainability which I would like to see become a conventional wisdom in Canada over the next 150 years.

My wish for Canada's next 150 years, are cities which make it easier for citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. For example, this means a built environment which incentivizes behaviour with positive externalities (e.g. transport choices such cycling and walking, which are low-cost and provide a net benefit in terms of individual quality of life, the environment, as well as public finances).

I wish for Canada to continue to engage in meaningful change, especially in regards to improving Native communities. Canada's story is quite unique in its demographic diversity with many living in Canada considering it their second home. I wish to see Canada's foreign policy be a testament to bettering the homelands of it's citizens. I wish for Canada, federally, provincially and locally to show ourselves and the world why we are the nicest people and for this to be seen in all aspects of society (economic system, environmental stance and social justice). I believe we are on our way to seeing this happen.

In the next 150 years, I hope Canada may remain multicultural and accepting of other cultures as it is now. But I hope in time that we can go a step further with (a) better integration of different cultures and people (b) more acceptance and understanding of other people's cultural instead of just tolerance that others are different. I hope we continue being the Canada the world knows - with the values of accepting new cultures with open arms. In the future I hope we don't ban other cultures from practicing their values and insist on conforming / assimilating to be Canadian. I definitely want to work towards continuing that in my professional career with policy.

Before we continue into the next 150 years of Canada's history, I would love for us to publicly accept and apologize for certain things that have occurred in the past. I believe that to truly move forward we must strengthen the cracks in our foundation, namely surrounding our relationship with the people of The First Nation.
 In the next 150 years, I wish for Canada to continue on the trajectory that the country has recently carved out for itself as a forward thinking, contemporary and accepting home for people of all walks of life. I wish for Canada's culture to flourish and evolve whilst always inheriting new cultures from those that immigrate into her.
 I wish for the Maple Leafs to win a Stanley Cup. I'm hoping 150 years is a long enough time...

My hope for Canada is to grow as a more harmonious country. Canada is doing great things right now, but we need to work more collaboratively to identify and address the issues youth in various parts of the country face. A youth in Yukon is facing significantly different issues then a youth in Jane Finch for example, but these issues are important. Canada needs create more dialogue.

There are several issues that I would like to see resolved within my lifetime, much earlier than 150 years from now, but I will discuss two. The number one issue that needs immediate attention is the unacceptable conditions of Indigenous communities across the country. Today, we still have many communities struggling with epidemics of youth suicide and domestic violence, substance abuse, a vast lack of employment opportunities, among many other issues. Culminating in the height of the emergency status that many Indigenous communities and individuals have existed in for decades is the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women - an issue that I relate to, to an extent, as a young, racialized, female survivor of sexual assault. My feelings on the topic of Indigenous issues in our country are so powerful that I believe we need to actively work towards reconciliation and solutions as soon as possible, in order to be a genuine global leader on social justice issues. The second issue I find most pressing in Canada, vital to change within 150 years, is electoral reform. Our current First-Past-The-Post system is outdated, limited, and unfair to the diversity of issues and interests that communities have throughout the country. A move away from such a system that encourages strategic voting will ensure that our key democratic processes are renewed and that our votes start to truly count.

I hope in the next 150 years we can become a country where all youth really do have equal opportunity, especially aboriginal youth, and that we can teach future generations to appreciate not just the history of Canada after the Europeans came but also the rich history of aboriginal cultures. I believe young Canadians don't know enough about the history of our country and therefore have difficulty truly appreciating it and how much better this country has become since it began.

Canada has done a fantastic job fostering national pride and reaping the benefits of our land over the past 150 years. As technology progresses I look forward to further development and urbanization in less populated areas of Canada as well as increased attention on the needs of its citizens. Past models of segregation and separation will hopefully be lomg eradicated and replaced with mixed neighborhood models to encourage conversation between peoples. There will be an increased quality of life and Canada will continue to be known as one of the safest places to live.

I hope that Canada will pursue the concept of sustainability and stop using more resources than the world can afford. I hope the Canadian government will hold corporations accountable for their acts of environmental degradation.

What would I like to see in the next 150 years of Canadian history? Women make up 51% o the global population. It would be phenomenal is the pay gap would finally cease to exist (it has been an issue for the last 70 years). Also, women should have more authority and positions of power. Secondly, Canada should respect the environment of abundance that we currently have. The way we are treating our country, we won’t make it to the next 150 years. It is our duty to respect what we have. Stop exploiting our country for profit. Canada has one fifth of the world’s fresh water. Just because those in politics, currently, won’t be on the earth much longer (in comparison) doesn’t mean they can’t think towards the future and the generations to follow. Don’t make your reports look good at the expense of human life.

Everyone can learn the history to prevent the wrongs from happening again. More love and more peace.

Canada should give back the respect, dignity and status back to Indigenous people. As is is very important for each and every individual who breathes on earth. Without considering sex, race, ethnicity and culture etc. into their agenda. Firstly, all are humans beings after that everyone has to be treated equally in the Rule of Law. It is really a sensitive issue in today’s world in all the countries.

I have seen Canada as one step ahead from most of the countries I have been in, but if I wish what Canada should be in the next 150 years is that it should be more open to all other types of people maybe in terms of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation etc. We should see all with one eye whether it is from any race. I will and am trying my best to see the world as well as my society in more open ways where everybody is same and there is no discrimination. The best and foremost to this solution should be providing EDUCATION. This is key to everything.
